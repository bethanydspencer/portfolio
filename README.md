This repository contains some example work.

The experimentation calculator folder includes calaculators for A/B testing using rates, probabilities and means as metrics. The scripts in R should be used for one comparison only (i.e. one metric and one varaint), because the alpha value is not corrected for multiple comparisons. This means that if you repeat this calculation for multiple metrics in the experiment, or multiple variants, the false positive rate will be much higher than the desired 5%.

The biophysics folder contains the code that I worked on for my masters project to simulate pacemaking ability in pulmonary vein cells.
